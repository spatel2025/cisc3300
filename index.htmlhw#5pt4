The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface given by browsers that
allows scripts to modify the content, structure, and appearance of a document while it is
being viewed. It serves as a basis for dynamic and interactive online applications, displaying
the page as a tree of objects that can be changed using languages such as JavaScript.

Structure of DOM (DOM Tree):
The DOM represents an HTML or XML document as a node-based tree. Each node
represents a section of the page, such as an element, property, or paragraph of text. In an
HTML page, the <html>, <body> and <p> tags correspond to different nodes in the DOM
tree.
