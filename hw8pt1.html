Meaning: Escaping data involves changing particular characters in strings that have unique meaning in certain situations (such as HTML, SQL, or JSON) into a representation that does not have that special importance. This is typically done to keep the data from being interpreted as code.

Escaping helps to avoid unauthorized execution by preventing input containing code from being run as part of the program. For example, in an online application, escaping user inputs avoids cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which occur when an attacker injects HTML or JavaScript code into web pages seen by other users.
