a. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural methodology for creating networked applications. It is based on the HTTP protocol, which is stateless, client-server, and cacheable. REST resources are modified using conventional HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE).

b. Statelessness: This means that each HTTP request sent from a client to a server must include all of the information required for the server to fulfill the request. The server does not save any session information about the client; each request is handled individually.

c. In REST, a resource is an item or piece of information that can be accessed using a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Resources are provided in a format that allows for easy interchange and manipulation (such as JSON or XML).

- Getting a list of users: The URL would be /users when utilizing the HTTP GET technique.

- Getting a specific user: The URL would be /users/{id} using the HTTP GET technique, where {id} is the user's unique identification.

- To save a user, use the HTTP POST method using the URL /users.
