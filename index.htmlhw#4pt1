1. JavaScript and Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages:

avaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is well-known for its use in
web development, where it allows for dynamic content on websites. The main distinction
between interpreted and compiled languages is how their code is executed. An interpreter
executes interpreted languages line by line at runtime, eliminating the requirement for them
to be pre-compiled into machine code. A compiler, on the other hand, converts compiled
languages into machine code before they are executed by the computer.
