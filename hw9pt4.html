PDO (PHP Data Objects) is a database access layer that provides a consistent manner of access to numerous databases. It does not offer a database abstraction, but it does give a consistent interface for working with various database systems.

Prepared statements: This feature allows you to perform the same (or comparable) SQL commands repeatedly with high efficiency. Prepared remarks are important since they:
They improve security by isolating SQL code from data, preventing SQL injection attacks.

Improve Performance: The SQL statement template is produced once and may be performed several times, resulting in faster parsing.

Promote Reusability and Readability: The same prepared statement may be run with multiple arguments, making code simpler and easier to maintain.
