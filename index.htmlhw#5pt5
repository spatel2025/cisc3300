XSS (cros-site scripting) attacks are a sort of security weakness commonly identified in
online applications. XSS attacks allow attackers to inject harmful scripts into material that
looks to come from a reliable source. When other users open and execute the affected
website, the malicious script runs in their browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies,
session tokens, or other sensitive information, as well as change the web page&#39;s content or
behaviour for malicious purposes. XSS attacks operate by utilizing a user&#39;s trust in a
particular website. For example, an attacker may find a means to inject a script into a
website, which is then mirrored back to the user and performed by their browser. This can
occur when forms, query parameters, or other inputs are not properly sanitized by the
online application.

How to prevent:

a.) Use proper sanitization: Make certain that every user input is properly sanitized to prevent
malicious code from being run. This frequently includes escaping special characters.
b.) Implement Content Security Policy (CSP): CSP is a browser feature that detects and
minimizes certain sorts of threats, such as XSS and data injection.
c.) Validate and encode: Validate all input upon arrival and encode data on output to guarantee
it is viewed as data rather than executable code.
d.) Use frameworks that automatically escape XSS. Many recent web development frameworks
provide built-in techniques to prevent XSS attacks.
