1. What happens from the time a user puts a URL into their browser to when they are able to view a webpage? - Briefly define ISP, URL, DNS, web server.

When a user puts a URL into their browser, it simply gives the browser an address.  For instance, the browser requests the ISP how to find the address.  Then the ISP checks the DNS to find the exact IP address.  This IP address is where the website is located (GPS).  After this, the browser then sends a request to the server of the website for the previous IP address that was used.  Lastly, the server will send the page of the website back and then the user is able to view the webpage.  ISP is the internet service provider which gives internet access to all users to be able to connect to the internet.  THE URL is the uniform resource locator which is the address of a particular resource on the web.  For example, it contains the “http”.  THE DNS is the domain name system which translates a url or domain name into a certain IP address so computers can detect it and find it on the internet.  A web server is what stores all the websites and gives users access to view them on the internet.
