2. Difference between var, let, and const:

Var declares a global or local variable to an entire function, regardless of block scope.

Let allows you to declare variables with a scope confined to the block, statement, or
expression in which they are used.

Const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned, and it, like let, is block scoped.
