4. JavaScript Objects vs. Traditional OOP Objects:

n JavaScript, objects include key-value pairs. They may store a variety of data kinds and can
be updated, copied, and examined during runtime. JavaScript&#39;s method for dealing with
objects and inheritance (based on prototypes) is different from traditional object-oriented
programming (OOP) languages that use classes as blueprints for objects.
