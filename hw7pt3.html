The MVC pattern is a software architecture pattern that divides an application into three major logical components: the model, view, and controller. Each of these components manages a separate component of the program.

Model: The Model component refers to any data-related logic that the user interacts with. This can represent the data that is transferred between the View and Controller components, as well as any other business logic-related data. For example, a Model may get data from a database, perform actions on it, and then return it to the View or Controller components.

View: The View component is responsible for the application's whole user interface logic. It delivers data to the user and determines how that data should be laid up. Views are frequently constructed using Model data, however the MVC model does not always specify how the Model data should be shown in the View.

Responsibilities include displaying the user interface and presenting model data, receiving user input, and communicating user actions to the Controller.
Controller: The Controller serves as an interface for the Model and View components, processing all business logic and incoming requests, modifying data using the Model component, and working with the Views to generate the final output. It interprets user inputs, provided through the View, into commands for the Model or View.
